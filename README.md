<h2 align="center">Soulless</h2>

This repo is a way for me to learn how to create a chatbox in a website.

> **Soulless** is an AI chatbox site. The use of this site is to provide an interactive, AI-powered expert for a souls games. Users can select a game from a dynamic image slider, and the chatbox will instantly become a knowledgeable assistant for that title.

<ins>The available games are</ins>:

* Dark Souls

* Dark Souls 2

* Dark Souls 3

* Bloodborne

* Elden Ring

* Sekiro

* Demon's Souls

* Hollow Knight

* Hollow Knight: Silksong (Not yet function as AI still thought Silksong hasn't been release yet.)

The entire project is deployed and hosted on Netlify. It uses **Netlify** Functions to run server-side code in a secure, serverless environment. This function acts as a proxy to protect the secret API key.

The conversational intelligence is provided by the Google **Gemini API** (gemini-2.5-flash model), which processes user questions and the game context to generate expert answers.

The main purpose of creating this site is to learn how to integrate AI into a website, knowing the "what" and the "how."
